"""Function to extract random entries (lines) from a CSV file

The function, randomSelectFromCSV, allows the user to specify the desired
number of entries to obtain from a comma-separated values (CSV) file
which contains data extracted from the STScI archive for ACS, WFC3, and
WFPC2 instruments. The data are comprised of the following information
as identified by the database name: observationID, trgName, trgposRA,
trgPosDec, detector, aperture, filters, enrBandpassName, timMin, timMax,
timExposure,and asnID.  The entries from the input table are chosen
at random with no duplication, and returned as an Astropy table.
