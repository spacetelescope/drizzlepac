#   DATE:    February 11, 2004
#   PURPOSE: Create an image combination algroithm that chooses between
#            a minimum or median image based up bad pixel identification.
#   HISTORY:
#      Version 0.1.0: Initial Development -- CJH -- 02/11/04
#      Version 0.1.1: Cast boxsize as type int.  This should always be the case
#        anyways but this protects against errors in the
#        MDRIZTAB -- CJH/WJH -- 07/08/04
#      Version 0.1.2: Improve error message handing in the case where
#        the boxcar convolution step fails.  --CJH -- 10/13/04
#      Version 0.2.0: The creation of the median image will now more closesly
#        replicate the IRAF IMCOMBINE behavior of nkeep = 1 and nhigh = 1.
#        -- CJH -- 03/29/05
#      Version 0.3.0: Rewritten to optimize the code and to bring
#        code up to modern standards.-- Mihai Cara -- 02/19/2018
