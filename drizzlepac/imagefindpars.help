These parameters control the operation of the algorithm that extracts
sources from the image as called by :ref:`tweakreg`.
The algorithm implemented follows the concepts defined
by ``DAOFIND`` (without actually using any ``DAOFIND`` code).


:Attributes:

    **computesig**: bool (Default = True)
        This parameter controls whether or not to automatically compute a
        sigma value to be used for object identification. If set to ``True``,
        then the value computed will override any user input for
        the parameter ``skysigma``. The automatic sigma value gets
        computed from each input exposure as:

        .. math::
            \sigma = \sqrt{2\left|mode\right|}

        This single value will then be used for object identification
        for all input exposures.

    **skysigma**: float (Default = 0.0)
        The standard deviation of the sky pixels. This value will only be
        used if computesig is ``False``.

    **conv_width**: float (Default = 3.5)
        The convolution kernel width in pixels. Recommended values
        (~2x the PSF FWHM): ACS/WFC & WFC3/UVIS ~3.5 pix and
        WFC3/IR ~2.5 pix.

    **peakmin**: float, None (Default = None)
        This parameter allows the user to select only those sources whose
        peak value (in the units of the input image) is greater than this
        value.

    **peakmax**: float, None  (Default = None)
        This parameter allows the user to select only those sources
        whose peak value (in the units of the input image) is less than
        this value.

    **threshold**: float (Default = 4.0)
        The object detection threshold above the local background in units
        of sigma.

    **nsigma**: float (Default = 1.5)
        The semi-major axis of the Gaussian convolution kernel used to
        compute the density enhancement and mean density images in
        Gaussian sigma.

    **ratio**: float (Default = 1.0)
        The ratio of the sigma of the Gaussian convolution kernel along
        the minor axis direction to the sigma along the major axis direction.
        For a circularly-symmetric kernel use ratio = 1.0.

    **theta**: float (Default = 0.0)
        The position angle (degrees) of the major axis of the Gaussian
        convolution kernel. Theta is measured counter-clockwise from
        the x axis.

    **fluxmin**: float, None (Default = None)
        This parameter allows the user to select only those sources whose
        total flux (in the units of the input image) is greater than
        this value.

    **fluxmax**: float, None (Default = None)
        This parameter allows the user to select only those sources whose
        total flux (in the units of the input image) is less than this value.

    **dqbits**: int, str, None, optional (Default = None)
        Integer sum of all the DQ bit values from the input image's DQ array
        that should be considered "good" when building masks for source
        finding. For example, if pixels in the DQ array can be combinations
        of 1, 2, 4, and 8 flags and one wants to consider DQ "defects"
        having flags 2 and 4 as being acceptable for source finding,
        then `dqbits` should be set to 2+4=6. Then a DQ pixel having values
        2,4, or 6 will be considered a good pixel, while a DQ pixel with
        a value, e.g., 1+2=3, 4+8=12, etc. will be flagged as a "bad" pixel.

        Alternatively, one can enter a comma- or '+'-separated list of
        integer bit flags that should be added to obtain the final "good"
        bits. For example, both ``4,8`` and ``4+8`` are equivalent to
        setting `dqbits` to 12.

        | Setting `dqbits` to 0 will make *all* non-zero pixels in the DQ
          mask to be considered "bad" pixels, and the corresponding image
          pixels will not be used for source finding.

        | The default value of `None` will turn off the use of image's DQ
          array for source finding.

        | In order to reverse the meaning of the `dqbits`
          parameter from indicating values of the "good" DQ flags
          to indicating the "bad" DQ flags, prepend '~' to the string
          value. For example, in order not to use pixels with
          DQ flags 4 and 8 for source finding and to consider
          as "good" all other pixels (regardless of their DQ flag),
          set `dqbits` to ``~4+8``, or ``~4,8``. To obtain the
          same effect with an `int` input value (except for 0),
          enter -(4+8+1)=-9. Following this convention,
          a `dqbits` string value of ``'~0'`` would be equivalent to
          setting ``dqbits=None``.

    **use_sharp_round**: bool (Default = False)
        This parameter controls whether or not to enable selection of sources
        based on their sharpness and roundness statistics.

    **sharplo**: float (Default = 0.2)
        ``sharplo`` and ``sharphi`` are designed to eliminate brightness
        maxima that are due to bad pixels rather than to astronomical objects.
        Only sources with sharpness above the ``sharplo`` value will be
        selected.

    **sharphi**: float (Default = 1.0)
        ``sharplo`` and ``sharphi`` are designed to eliminate brightness
        maxima that are due to bad pixels rather than to astronomical objects.
        Only sources with sharpness below the ``sharphi`` value will be
        selected.

    **roundlo**: float (Default = -1.0)
        ``roundlo`` and ``roundhi`` are designed to eliminate brightness
        maxima that are due to bad rows or columns, rather than to
        astronomical objects. Only sources with roundness above the
        ``roundlo`` value will be selected.

    **roundhi**: float (Default = 1.0)
        ``roundlo`` and ``roundhi`` are designed to eliminate brightness
        maxima that are due to bad rows or columns, rather than to
        astronomical objects. Only sources with roundness below the
        ``roundhi`` value will be selected.
