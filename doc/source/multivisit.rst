Multi-visit Mosaic Processing
=============================

Multi-Visit Mosaic (MVM)
    A Multi-Visit Mosaic (MVM) is a single image (product) made by combining all observations taken of the same part of the sky.

Observations taken of the same part of the sky over all the years that HST has been operational can enable unique science
due to the high-resolution of the HST cameras.  Generating useful mosaics from these observations, though, requires
solving a number of key problems; namely,

  * aligning all the images to the same coordinate system
  * define the size on the sky of each mosaic
  * defining what exposures should go into each mosaic

MVM processing implemented as part of the Hubble Advanced Products (HAP) pipeline generates new products based on
solutions implemented for these critical issues.


Alignment
==========
Generating MVM products relies entirely on the definition of the WCS of each input image in order to define where each
exposure will land in the output mosaic.  Errors in an input exposure's WCS will lead to misalignment of overlapping
exposures resulting in smeared sources or even multiple images of the overlapping sources in the output mosaic.  Errors
in the WCS primarily stem from images being aligned to different astrometric catalogs.  For example,
one exposure may be aligned successfully to the GAIADR2 catalog, yet another overlapping exposure can only be aligned
to the 2MASS catalog due to the lack of GAIA sources in the offset exposure.

MVM processing relies entirely on the alignment that can be performed on the exposures during standard pipeline processing
and subsequently as part of the Single-Visit Mosaic (SVM) processing.  This allows each visit to be aligned to the most
accurate catalog available while taking into account the proper motions of the astrometric sources in the field based on
the date the exposures were taken in the visit.

By default, the most current GAIA catalog will
be used as the default astrometric catalog for aligning all exposures which typically results in images that are aligned
well enough to avoid serious misalignment artifacts in the regions of overlap. Unfortunately, due to the nature of some
of the fields observed by HST, not all exposures can be aligned to a GAIA-based
catalog using GAIA astrometric sources.  As a result, the sources used for alignment will have much larger errors on the
sky compared to the errors of GAIA astrometric sources which can lead to offsets from the GAIA coordinate system of a
significant fraction of an HST pixel (or even multiple HST pixels).  This will lead to artifacts in MVM products where
such exposures overlap other exposures aligned to other catalogs, especially GAIA-based catalogs.


Defining the Mosaic on the Sky
==============================
MVM products need to be defined in order to understand what input exposures will contribute to each mosaic.  The solution
implemented for HAP MVM products relies on tesselation of the entire sky using the same basic tiles defined by the
PanSTARRS project as described at `PanSTARRS Sky tessellation patterns
<https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/PS1+Sky+tessellation+patterns>`_.

  north celestial pole.


.. figure:: images/figure_pole.png
  :figwidth: 90%
  :alt: PS1 projection cells near the north celestial pole.

  PS1 projection cells near the north celestial pole, where the image overlap is greatest due to convergence of the RA grid.
  The projection cells are 4°x4° in size and are on rings spaced by 4° in declination.

MVM processing uses these pre-defined projection cells after extending them to cover the entire sky
with cells that are actually 4.2°x4.2° in size and are on rings spaced by 4° apart in declination.  This provides
sufficient overlap to allow data from one projection cell to be merged with data from a neighboring cell if necessary.
These cells, defined as the ProjectionCell object in the code and referred to as **ProjectionCell**, are indexed
starting at 0 at δ = −90° (South Pole) and ending at 2643 at δ = +90° (North Pole).  As stated in the
`PanSTARRS page <https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/PS1+Sky+tessellation+patterns>`_:

  The projection cell centers are located on lines of constant declination spaced 4° apart. At a given declination,
  the pointing centers are equally spaced in right ascension around the sky, with the number of RA points changing to
  account for the convergence of RA lines in the spherical sky. The pattern is defined to cover the entire sky from
  δ = −90° to +90°... Within a given declination zone, the projection cells are centered at RA(n) = n Δα = n 360°/M where
  M is the number of RA cells in the zone. Finally, the projection cells themselves are numbered consecutively
  (ordered by increasing RA) starting at 0 at the south pole, 1–9 at δ = −86°, etc.

All these definitions, including how finely each ProjectionCell should be divided to define the SkyCells, are encoded in a
FITS table installed as part of the `drizzlepac` package:

    drizzlepac/pars/allsky_cells.fits


.. _defining_skycells :

Defining each SkyCell
----------------------
Each ProjectionCell is split into a grid of 21 x 21 'sky cells' which serves as the most basic MVM product generated
during MVM processing.  Sky cells, as defined as the SkyCell object in the code and referred to as **SkyCell**,
are approximately 0.2° x 0.2° in size (~21500 x ~21500 pixels) and
they have the same WCS as the ProjectionCell.  Each SkyCell gets identified by its position within the ProjectionCell
as shown in this figure:

.. figure:: images/SkyCell_numbering.png
  :width: 90%
  :alt: Numbering convention for SkyCells within a Projection Cell.

  Numbering convention for SkyCells within a Projection Cell used for naming the SkyCell.

The numbering of the SkyCells within a ProjectionCell starts in the lower left corner at (1,1) corresponding to the cell
with the lowest declination and largest RA since the SkyCell is oriented so that the Y axis follows a line of RA
pointing towards the North Pole.
This indexing provides a way to identify uniquely any position on the sky and can be used as the basis for a unique filename for
all products generated from the exposures that overlap each SkyCell.  Mosaics generated for each SkyCell uses this
indexing to create files with names using the convention:

  skycell-p<PPPP>x<XX>y<YY>

where:
  ==========  =========================================================================
  Element     Definition
  ==========  =========================================================================
  <PPPP>      ProjectionCell ID as a zero-padded 4 digit integer
  <XX>,<YY>   SkyCell ID within ProjectionCell as zero-padded 2 digit integers
  ==========  =========================================================================

The WCS for each SkyCell gets defined as a subarray of the Projection cell's WCS.  This allows data across SkyCells in
the same ProjectionCell to be combined into larger mosaics as part of the same tangent plane without performing any
additional resampling.

Code for Defining SkyCell ID
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The code for interfacing with the cell definitions table can be imported in Python using:

.. code:: python

   from drizzlepac.haputils import cell_utils

Determining what SkyCells overlap any given set of exposures on the sky can be done using the function:

.. code:: python

  sky_cells_dict = cell_utils.get_sky_cells(visit_input, input_path=None)

where **visit_input** is the Python list of filenames of FLT/FLC exposures.  These files can be any set of FLT/FLC files
and the WCS solutions defined in them will, by default, **be used as-is** to create the final combined mosaics.  The MVM products
generated in the HST pipeline and stored in the HST archive will be generated using FLT/FLC files that have been aligned
to an astrometric catalog like GAIAeDR3 during SVM processing, if alignment was possible at all for the exposure.  The full
set of parameters that can be used to control the sky cell definitions and IDs can be found in the
:ref:`MVM Processing Code API page<multivisit_api>`.

Exposures in an input list are assumed to be in the current working directory when running the code,
unless **input_path** has been provided which points to the location of the exposures to be processed.
The return value **sky_cells_dict** is a dictionary where the keys are the names (labels) of each overlapping SkyCell
and the value is the actual SkyCell object which contains the footprint and WCS (among other details) of the SkyCell.

For example, observations from HST proposal 14175 were taken to study NGC 4594 (Sombrero Galaxy) using both the ACS and
WFC3 cameras.  The footprints of all the HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 observations taken in this part of the sky as shown by MAST
can be seen here:

.. figure:: images/pg1202_acs_wfc3_mast_footprint.png
  :width: 90%
  :alt: Footprints of HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 observations of PG1202+281 and surrounding area.

  Footprints of HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 observations of the the quasar PG1202+281 and surrounding area.

There were 25 FLT and FLC exposures taken as part of this proposal making up these footprints.  The list of these
files defined what was provided as **visit_input** to the `cell_utils.get_sky_cells()` function to get these SkyCell
definitions:

.. code:: python

    sky_cells_dict = cell_utils.get_sky_cells(visit_input, input_path=None)
    sky_cells_dict

    {'skycell-p1889x07y19': SkyCell object: skycell-p1889x07y19,
     'skycell-p1889x07y20': SkyCell object: skycell-p1889x07y20,
     'skycell-p1970x15y03': SkyCell object: skycell-p1970x15y03,
     'skycell-p1970x15y02': SkyCell object: skycell-p1970x15y02,
     'skycell-p1970x16y02': SkyCell object: skycell-p1970x16y02}

This indicates that these exposures overlap 5 SkyCells in 2 ProjectionCells **p1889** and **p1970** with the WCS defined in the
defined SkyCell object for each SkyCell entry in this dictionary.  Each SkyCell object includes a list of all the
exposures that overlap just that SkyCell, which can be used to generate those mosaics.  Full details of the contents
of the SkyCell object can be found in the
:ref:`Multi-visit Processing API documentation<multivisit_api>`.

We can see that one SkyCell includes all exposures using:

.. code:: python

    for sky_cell in sky_cells_dict:
        print(sky_cell, len(sky_cells_dict[sky_cell].members))

    skycell-p1889x07y19 25
    skycell-p1889x07y20 8
    skycell-p1970x15y03 8
    skycell-p1970x15y02 17
    skycell-p1970x16y02 8

All subsequent examples will use the exposures for SkyCell **skycell-p1889x07y19**.


Input Poller File
------------------
The MVM processing could simply combine whatever input files are present in the current working directory.  However,
that may result in working with more than 1 SkyCell at a time which can, for some steps, end up requiring more memory
or disk space than is available on the system.  Therefore, the code relies on an input `poller file` which specifies exactly
what files should be processed at one time.  This ASCII CSV-formatted input `poller file` will only contain
the names of exposures which
overlap only a single SkyCell regardless of instrument, detector or any other observational configuration.

Generating one of these input 'poller' files with the filename *skycell-p1889x07y19_mvm_input.txt* can be done using
the same SkyCell dictionary defined earlier with the commands:

.. code:: python

    from drizzlepac.haputils import make_poller_files as mpf

    with open('skycell-p1889x07y19_input.txt', 'w') as fout:
        _ = [fout.write(f'{sky_cell}\n') for sky_cell in sky_cells_dict['skycell-p1889x07y19'].members]

    mpf.generate_poller_file('skycell-p1889x07y19_input.txt',
                             poller_file_type='mvm',
                             output_poller_filename='skycell-p1889x07y19_mvm_poller.txt',
                             skycell_name='skycell-p1889x07y19')


The full description of the function used to create this poller file can be found in the
:ref:`Multi-visit Processing Code API documentation<multivisit_api>`.

This input file *skycell-p1889x07y19_mvm_input.txt* can then be used as input to the top-level MVM processing code using:

.. code:: python

    from drizzlepac import hapmultisequencer
    rv = hapmultisequencer.run_mvm_processing("skycell-p1889x07y19_mvm_poller.txt")

The `poller file` contains 1 line for each input exposure for a given SkyCell.  The form of the file, though,
is a comma-separated (CSV) formatted file with all the same information as the SVM input files plus a couple of
extra columns; namely,

  * SkyCell ID
  * status of MVM processing

An example of an exposure's line in the poller file would be:

.. code-block::

  hst_12286_0r_acs_wfc_f775w_jbl70rtv_flc.fits,12286,BL7,0R,486.0,F775W,WFC,skycell-p1889x07y19,NEW,g:\data\mvm\p1889x07y19\hst_12286_0r_acs_wfc_f775w_jbl70rtv_flc.fits

where the elements of each line are defined as:

.. code-block::

        filename, proposal_id, program_id, obset_id, exptime, filters, detector, skycell-p<PPPP>x<XX>y<YY>, [OLD|NEW], pathname

The SkyCell ID will be included in this input information to allow for grouping of exposures into the same SkyCell layer based on filter, exptime, and year.

The value of **'NEW'** specifies that this exposure should be considered as never having been combined into this SkyCell's
mosaic before.  A value of **'OLD'** instead allows the code to recognize layers that are unaffected by 'NEW' data so
that those layers can be left alone and NOT processed again unnecessarily.  As such, it can serve as a useful summary of all
the input exposures used to generate the mosaics for the SkyCell.


Defining SkyCell Layers
------------------------
Defining the SkyCell for a region on the sky allows for the identification of all exposures that overlap that WCS.
However, creating a single mosaic from data taken with different detectors and filters would not result in a
meaningful result.  Therefore, the exposures that overlap each SkyCell get grouped based on the detector and filter used
to take the exposure to define a 'layer' of the SkyCell.  Each layer can then be generated as the primary basic image
product for each SkyCell.  Exposures taken with spectroscopic elements, like grisms and prisms, and exposures taken of
moving targets can not be used to create layers due to the inability to align them with the rest of the observations.
Therefore, only images taken with standard filters (like the WFC3/UVIS F275W filter) will be used to define SkyCell
mosaics (layers).

The default plate scale for all MVM image products for each SkyCell has been defined as 0.04"/pixel to match the higher
resolution imaging performed by the WFC3/UVIS detector.  However, WFC3/IR data suffers from serious resampling artifacts
when drizzling IR data to that plate scale. So in addition to creating IR mosaics at the 0.04"/pixel 'fine' plate scale,
IR mosaics are also generated at a 'coarse' plate scale of 0.12"/pixel to minimize the resampling artifacts while also being easily
scaled to the 'fine' plate scale mosaics.

SkyCell Layers Example
'''''''''''''''''''''''
For example, observations were taken with Proposals 12286 and 12903 using both the ACS and WFC3 cameras and
multiple filters. The ACS observations were taken
with the ACS/WFC detector using the F775W and F850LP filters, while the WFC3 observations were taken using the IR detector
using the F105W, F125W  and F160W filters as well as the UVIS detector using the F475W.
All these observations fall within the SkyCell at position **x07y19** in the
ProjectionCell **p1889**, but given the dramatic plate scale differences, these observations can not be used to create a
single mosaic.

The different observing modes used for observations in this SkyCell end up being organized as
9 separate layers (mosaics); namely,

  * wfc3_uvis_f475w (0.04"/pixel)
  * wfc3_ir_f105w_coarse  (0.12"/pixel)
  * wfc3_ir_f105w  (0.04"/pixel)
  * wfc3_ir_f125w_coarse  (0.12"/pixel)
  * wfc3_ir_f125w  (0.04"/pixel)
  * wfc3_ir_f160w_coarse  (0.12"/pixel)
  * wfc3_ir_f160w  (0.04"/pixel)
  * acs_wfc_f850lp  (0.04"/pixel)
  * acs_wfc_f775w  (0.04"/pixel)

Since they all have the same WCS, modulo the plate scale differences, they can be overlaid pixel-by-pixel with each other for
analysis.

You can verify this interactively by directly calling the code that interprets the input 'poller' file using:

.. code:: python

    from drizzlepac.haputils import poller_utils

    obs_dict, tdp_list = poller_utils.interpret_mvm_input('skycell-p1889x07y19_mvm_poller.txt',
                                                          log_level=poller_utils.logutil.logging.INFO)
    for layer in obs_dict:
        print(obs_dict[layer]['info'])

    skycell-p1889x07y19 wfc3 uvis f475w all all 1 drz fine
    skycell-p1889x07y19 wfc3 ir f105w all all 1 drz coarse

    skycell-p1889x07y19 acs wfc f775w all all 1 drc fine

    print(tdp_list)

    [<drizzlepac.haputils.product.SkyCellProduct at 0x1fd04dcc220>,
     <drizzlepac.haputils.product.SkyCellProduct at 0x1fd04d49a60>,
     <drizzlepac.haputils.product.SkyCellProduct at 0x1fd04d49cd0>,
     <drizzlepac.haputils.product.SkyCellProduct at 0x1fd04dccd30>,
     <drizzlepac.haputils.product.SkyCellProduct at 0x1fd04dcc0a0>,

     <drizzlepac.haputils.product.SkyCellProduct at 0x1fd04d53910>]

These objects define the WCS, inputs and filenames for each layer for use in creating these products.  Full details
of the contents of the **SkyCellProduct** can be found in
:ref:`Multi-visit Processing Code API documentation<multivisit_api>`.


MVM Processing Steps
====================
The definitions for the ProjectionCell and SkyCell allow for all HST observations to be processed into a logical set of
image mosaic products regardless of how many observations cover any particular spot on the sky while tying them all
together in the same astrometric reference frame (as much as possible, anyway).  The steps taken to generate these
MVM products can be summarized as:

  * Determine what SkyCell or set of SkyCells each exposure overlaps
  * Copy all relevant exposures for a given SkyCell into a single directory for that SkyCell
  * Rename input exposures to have MVM-specific filenames
  * Generate input file to be used for processing each SkyCell
  * Evaluate all input exposures to define all layers needed for the SkyCell
  * Determine which layer to process
  * Drizzle all exposures for each layer to be processed to create new mosaic product for that layer

Running MVM Processing
----------------------
The primary function used to perform MVM processing interactively in a Python session is:

.. code:: python

   from drizzlepac import hapmultisequencer
   r = hapmultisequencer.run_mvm_processing(input_filename)

The function takes several optional parameters to control aspects of the processing, with full details of this function's
parameters and all related functions being described in :ref:`Multi-visit Processing API<multivisit_api>`.


SkyCell Membership
------------------
Data from HST gets organized based on a filename derived from the proposal used to define the observations and how
HST should take them.  MVM processing, on the other hand, focuses on how the observations relate to each other on the
sky based on the WCS information.  The `drizzlepac/haputils/cell_utils.py` module includes the code used to interpret
the WCS information for exposures and determine what ProjectionCells and SkyCells each exposure overlaps as shown in the
section on the `Code for Defining SkyCell ID`_.

This code can be called on any set of user-defined exposures to determine for the first time what SkyCells the
exposures overlap.  During HST pipeline processing, this code gets called for the exposures from each visit after they
have finished SVM processing and after they have been aligned as much as possible to the latest astrometric reference frame (such
as the GAIAeDR3 catalog).  Using these updated WCS solutions provides the most accurate placement of the exposures on
the sky and therefore in the correct SkyCell.


Copy Data
----------
The MVM processing code requires the input exposures to be located in the current working directory as the processing may
require the ability to update the input files with the results of the MVM processing.  Each input file may also overlap
more than 1 SkyCell.  As a result, the input files get copied into a directory set up specifically for processing a
given SkyCell.  This results in each input file being copied into as many directories as needed to support creating the mosaics
for as many SkyCells as desired while protecting the integrity of the original input files and their WCS solutions.


Rename Input Files
-------------------
The MVM processing code works on the input files provided using the WCS solutions defined in the headers of the input
files as-is for the initial implementation.  However, in order to preserve the solutions defined by previous processing
steps, these files are renamed based on the SkyCell to be generated in the current working directory.

For reference, the original pipeline-assigned name has the format of:

  `IPPPSSOOT_flc.fits`

such as
  * jcz906dvq_flc.fits
  * icz901wpq_flc.fits

The MVM filename defined for the **input exposures** follows the convention.

  `hst_skycell-p<PPPP>x<XX>y<YY>_<instr>_<detector>_<filter>_<ipppssoo>_fl[ct].fits`

where:
  ==========  =========================================================================
  Element     Definition
  ==========  =========================================================================
  <PPPP>      ProjectionCell ID as a zero-padded 4 digit integer
  <XX>,<YY>   SkyCell ID within ProjectionCell as zero-padded 2 digit integers
  <instr>     Name of HST instrument from **INSTRUME** header keyword
  <detector>  Name of detector from **DETECTOR** header keyword
  <filter>    Name of filter from **FILTER** or **FILTER1,FILTER2** header keyword(s)
  <ipppssoo>  Pipeline-assigned **IPPPSSOO** designation from original input filename
  fl[ct]      Suffix of either **flt** or **flc** from original input filename
  ==========  =========================================================================

This insures that each exposure gets renamed in a way that allows them to be easily identified with respect to the
**output SkyCell layer** the exposure contributes to during MVM processing.

.. note::
  The currently implemented MVM processing **does not update the WCS and DQ arrays**
  of these input files in any way. As a result, they only get used
  as intermediate products, and get deleted automatically upon
  **successful completion** of MVM processing.  Should future updates to MVM processing
  be implemented, for example to further refine the alignment, then these products would
  get updated at that time and be added as a new product to the HST archive instead of being deleted.


Primary MVM Processing Interface
---------------------------------
MVM processing gets controlled through a single function:

.. code:: python

    from drizzlepac import runmultihap

    rv = runmultihap.process(input_filename)

This function takes as either form of the input file generated for the input exposures in the current directory
as the input parameter `input_filename`.  This function then performs all the processing steps automatically to
generate the image mosaics from the exposures listed in the input file.

There are times, though, when the default processing needs to be revised to account for the science goals of the
processing or to account for the exposures available as inputs.  The following environmental variables can be used to control
how the MVM processing deals with various types of input files:

MVM_INCLUDE_SMALL
  This controls whether or not layers are created for ACS/HRC or ACS/SBC exposures given their
  small field-of-view.  By default, this is turned on ('true') so that these layers are created.

MVM_ONLY_CTE
  This controls whether or not to include exposures which have NOT been CTE-corrected due to the
  potential impact to the output mosaics PSFs from including exposures with CTE tails.  By default,
  this is actually turned off ('false') so that all data gets used.

These variables can be set to values of 'on', 'off', 'true', 'false', 'yes' or 'no' in the operating system environment
or even in the python environment using `os.environ`.

Additionally, the function `hapmultisequencer.run_mvm_processing()`, which gets called by `runmultihap.process()`,
has the ability to enable an additional attempt to align all the
input exposures to the latest astrometric catalog, as well as limit the size of the output mosaics.
Full details of these parameters are available in the discussion of the
:ref:`Multi-visit Processing Code API documentation<multivisit_api>`.


Define SkyCell Layers
----------------------
SkyCells define the WCS that will be used for all the observations for any given region on the sky.  However, it doesn't
make sense to create a single image from all the exposures due to differences in the detectors, pixel sizes, PSFs and
filters used for the observations.  It can even be argued that observations taken too far apart in time should also not
be combined, or observations taken with dramatic differences in exposure time should not be combined.  As a result,
the concept of a SkyCell 'layer' was implemented to organize all the exposures for a SkyCell into sets of exposures which
can be combined to create useful, and hopefully scientifically interesting, mosaics.

The most basic definition for a layer organizes the exposures based on the following criteria:

  * instrument
  * detector
  * filter

Using the renamed input files, the MVM processing code organizes all the exposures based on these criteria to identify
what layers could be generated from all the inputs.  For example, a SkyCell with ACS/WFC3 F814W exposures and
WFC3/UVIS F606W exposures would result in 2 SkyCell layers being defined; namely, one for each set of exposures.

.. note:: Observations taken with a spectroscopic element, like grisms or prisms, will not be used to define SkyCell layers.


Determine Layers to Process
----------------------------
Specifying what input exposures need to be used to create a SkyCell layer mosaic serves as a critical feature of the
input file.  Input files simply listing filenames indicate that ALL exposures specified should be used to create MVM
products.  However, the more descriptive `poller file` CSV format input file provides the ability to limit the processing
to only new exposures, while treating already archived versions of the MVM products for all the other SkyCell layers as
fully updated and not in need of any further processing.  This control comes from the entry that specifies 'NEW' or 'OLD',
with only those layers with at least 1 'NEW' entry getting defined for processing.


Create SkyCell Mosaics
----------------------
The input files get interpreted to define the image products that
need to be created when combining the exposures.  These mosaics get generated by drizzling the
input exposures onto the WCS defined for the SkyCell, creating a separate mosaic for each layer from all the exposures
with the same filter/detector/instrument configuration.

The drizzle parameters used to create these products are determined based on the average number of exposures for all the
exposed pixels in the SkyCell layer.  This only serves as an approximation of what would work best across the entire
SkyCell layer, as some portions may only have a single exposure while other regions may have many overlapping exposures.
However, this still works reasonably well due to the fact that only the following drizzle steps are actually applied when
creating the MVM products:

  * sky matching
  * final drizzling with bad pixel rejection

These products, thus, rely entirely on the DQ arrays to be updated by SVM and pipeline processing to flag cosmic-rays and
detector artifacts as bad pixels so those pixels get rejected when creating the MVM product.  In addition, they rely
on the WCS solutions provided by previous processing as well to place the exposures in the final MVM product.

The parameters used for creating these drizzle products can be found installed with the package's code.  You can find
the files using:

.. code-block::

    import os
    import drizzlepac
    #
    # Directory is:  drizzlepac/pars/hap_pars/mvm_parameters
    #
    os.chdir(os.path.join(drizzlepac.__path__, 'pars', 'hap_pars', 'mvm_parameters'))

There are separate configuration files for each detector based on the number of average exposures in the output frame.

The final output products get created with a final output array size that is trimmed down to only the subsection of the
entire SkyCell which has HST data in any layer.

Finally, the output drizzle product will have a filename that follows the basic convention used to rename the input
exposures without the final 'ipppssoo' designation; namely,

  `hst_skycell-p<PPPP>x<XX>y<YY>_<instr>_<detector>_<filter>_<layer>_dr[cz].fits`

where:
  ==========  =========================================================================
  Element     Definition
  ==========  =========================================================================
  <PPPP>      ProjectionCell ID as a zero-padded 4 digit integer
  <XX>,<YY>   SkyCell ID within ProjectionCell as zero-padded 2 digit integers
  <instr>     Name of HST instrument from **INSTRUME** header keyword
  <detector>  Name of detector from **DETECTOR** header keyword
  <filter>    Name of filter from **FILTER** or **FILTER1,FILTER2** header keyword(s)
  <layer>     Layer-specific designation: coarse-all or all
  dr[cz]      Suffix of either **DRZ** or **DRC** based on input filenames
  ==========  =========================================================================

The *<layer>* component of the MVM filename indicates the plate scale and any other criteria used to define the layer
such as exposure time or date range of exposures used to create the layer.  At present, only WFC3/IR data gets generated
with both the default (fine) plate-scale of 0.04"/pixel as well as the IR-native "coarse" plate scale which show up with
a *<layer>* term of **coarse-all**.  Initial processing does not apply any additional definitions for the layers, and thus
the remainder of the initially generated MVM products simply have a *<layer>* term of **all**.  Future processing may
enable generation of additional layers based on date ranges for SkyCells which have massive amount of exposures over a
large range of dates, in which case this *<layer>* term will be updated to reflect those ranges.  Additionally, the
code can be run interactively to enable generation of additional layers based on exposure time ranges as well.  See
explanation of the processing code functions for more details.
