Getting Started

DrizzlePac is designed to optimally align and combine multiple exposures into a single "drizzled" image in order to recover the maximum possible sensitivity and spatial resolution from HST imaging. STScI uses DrizzlePac to produce science-ready mosaics that can be accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). However, the pipeline cannot optimize the DrizzlePac settings for every observation type and science case, so users are encouraged to create their own mosaics to incorporate custom calibrations, alignment strategies, and fine-tuning of the AstroDrizzle parameters. This Getting Started guide provides instructions on how to install DrizzlePac, as well as links to the main website, handbook, example notebooks, and instructions for requesting assistance through the HST Help Desk.
