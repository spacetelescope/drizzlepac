# Installation

## Conda (Recommended)

`Drizzlepac` is installed when you install the `stenv` conda environment (a replacement for `astroconda`). Select your desired release and follow the instructions on the [`stenv` installation page](https://stenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html). 

## Install with pip

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/drizzlepac.git
```
The option `--no-use-pep517` MAY be required in order to correctly build 
the C extensions with `pip` versions up to 22.2, after commenting out 
the `build-backend` from the `pyproject.toml` config file.

Support for installing using `pip` is still evolving, so use of this 
command is provided on an experimental basis for now.

## From Source

### Clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/drizzlepac
$ cd drizzlepac
```

### Build the documentation

*Note:* If you intend to use `drizzlepac`'s embedded help feature from within
an interactive `python` or `ipython` session, we recommend you do not skip
this step.

```bash
$ cd doc/
$ make html
```

### Install DrizzlePac

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```
